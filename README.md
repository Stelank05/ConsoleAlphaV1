# ConsoleAlphaV1
Console Alpha V1 of a Game I desire to make in the future

Written In C# in order to use parts of another program that does this but with a UI and other editor features that weren't necessary for this.
Requires Contents of Setup Folder to run, with 'Series.csv' located where it is and with the same name, else the Program won't find the Root Folder.
It is possible to change the Included Entrants, via the Entrants Folder, and the Class X Files in there (Up to 8 Classes Possible)
Ideally, its Download, Unzip, Plonk Somewhere, open Visual Studio, and hit F5.
